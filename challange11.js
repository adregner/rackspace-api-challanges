// Challenge 11: Write an application that will:
// Create an SSL terminated load balancer (Create self-signed certificate.)
// Create a DNS record that should be pointed to the load balancer.
// Create Three servers as nodes behind the LB.
// Each server should have a CBS volume attached to it. (Size and type are irrelevant.)
// All three servers should have a private Cloud Network shared between them.
// Login information to all three servers returned in a readable format as the result of the script, including connection information.
// Worth 6 points
